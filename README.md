# Software Setup

We strongly suggest using conda (or miniconda) for package management. For this assignment, you will need to install PyTorch.

Most of the dependencies can be installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. For any other package dependencies, use conda / pip to install when they come up as needed. 

EDIT: just running the following is easier and enough: 

`pip install torch numpy==1.23.0 h5py imageio matplotlib torchvision`
